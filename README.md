# RSS 2018 Data Science Hackathon

This repository holds all material for the hackathon event at the RSS Conference 2018.

## Introduction

In this Hackathon hosted by Mango Solutions for the RSS, we want to help demystify what it means to do data science ‘in the wild’ by providing an opportunity to work with open data sets on a challenging problem.

The topic for the Hackathon is UK politics, with the data kindly provided by the hard efforts of [https://github.com/six50](https://github.com/six50).

We will be looking at past data on peoples voting patterns and demographics in order to have a go at two main tasks:

1. Visualising election results and other data across constituencies on a geographic map. 
2. Building models and predicting turnout at general elections using past results and polling data. 

In addition, both of these tasks will require an amount of data prep and manipulation to get to the end result. Examples are provided in this repository in both the R and Python programming languages (though you are free to use you own tools of choice as well!). Participants are encourages to go through these to build familiarity with the data and then build upon them with there own ideas for improvement. 


## Prerequisites

* If you are using Python, make sure you have the Anaconda Python distribution installed for Python 3.6. It can be downloaded from [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

* If you are using R, make sure you have recent version of R and Rstudio installed. R can be downloaded from [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/), and Rstudio from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Extract the data. The data folder contains zip files for each set of data. Unzipping them inplace will create the necessary folder structure for the examples. 

3. Install dependencies by following [setup-R.md](./setup-R.md) or [setup-Python.md](./setup-Python.md)

4. Either launch Rstudio (for R) or Jupyter Notebook (for Python) and navigate to the `examples/` directory. 

5. Step through the examples, gain intuition and extend!
